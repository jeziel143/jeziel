<li> HISTORY </li>
<br>
<li> The history of beauty product historians can trace our use of beauty products and cosmetics back to 4,000 BC, and the ancient Egyptians who used kohl to create dramatic eyes. Today, the worldwide beauty industry, which covers everything from hair and skin care to make-up is an estimated $425 billion industry. The history of the beauty industry is as diverse and colorful as the lipsticks and nail polishes on display at your local make-up counter.

Early beauty and cosmetic regimes relied heavy upon natural ingredients, including berries, bugs, and charcoal to create a variety of colors, and many products were used for more than one purpose, a preview of today’s  makeup  multi-taskers. Early beauty treatments also utilized the area’s natural resources, locally sourcing natural ingredients for scrubs, pastes, and exfoliates. This pattern of using local, natural ingredients is an ongoing trend throughout the history of the beauty industry. </li>
